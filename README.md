Sentiment Analysis and NER on books from the Partition Era

## Summary

Why did the Partition of the Indian subcontinent take place? Historians and literary scholars alike have struggled with this question for over seven decades, focussing on the high politics of big players like the British, the Congress and the Muslim League. One of the commonly held assumptions is that religious differences played a key role in fomenting communal sentiments, leading to widespread riots in the years leading up to Partition. This project aims to reorient the  scholarly gaze by focussing on literary texts — mainstream political machinations lie at the margins of these works as they focus on the lived experience of Partition and everyday negotiation of religious differences. What might these texts convey about the sentiments associated with various religions in the popular consciousness? What kinds of collectives (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh or a more fluid notion of watan) are perceived positively or negatively? In addition, sentiment analysis might also point us towards other causal factors that, in the perception of the common people populating these novels, precipitated the Partition.


## Research Hypothesis

Partition literature presents a syncretic worldview quite different from the anti-Muslim rhetoric that permeates discussions about the reasons and consequences of Partition today. Consequently, it can be argued that irreconcilable religious differences were not the primary cause for Partition. 
  
To prove this hypothesis, we will attempt to examine the sentiments associated with popular markers of Muslimness in particular. Tangentially, we will attempt to explore who might have been deemed the villain of the Partition story in the popular consciousness — in other words, which powerful entities are surrounded with negative sentiments in the novels. In the process, we will also attempt to understand the sentiments surrounding the ideas of nationhood, Partition and freedom.

## Corpus Description

We selected five novels about the Partition written by authors of Indian origin. These include — Bhisham Sahni’s *Tamas* (1973), Khushwant Singh’s *Train to Pakistan* (1956), Amrita Pritam’s *Pinjar* (1950), Amitav Ghosh’s *The Shadow Lines* (1988), and Salman Rushdie’s *Midnight’s Children* (1981). Since these novels are temporally dispersed, they might allow us a glimpse of the changing trends in the genre. Moreover, the writers hail from different religious backgrounds which might allow us a more balanced perspective on the religious politics depicted in their works. A possible shortcoming of the selected corpus could be that two of the texts — *Tamas* and *Pinjar* — appear in translation, possibly diluting the meanings found in the original texts. The Urdu word ‘watan’, for instance, carries a different emotional valence than its English counterparts, ‘nation’ or ‘country’.
